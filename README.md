# hello-world
My first repository

Turbo Pascal was my introduction to computer programming, and perhaps the reason I did not pursue a degree in compueter sciences but instead opted to go into construction management. As a project manager in the construction industry, I had some very specific problems and used MS-Access and VBA to develop software to help us.

Now I want to expand my skillset to be able to develop web based applications through completing the course at FreeCodeCamp.
